Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Gaming room was a mobile app company that had success already within the Android mobile platform. They were looking to develop software that would enable them to operate on all platforms to increase their market.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

My argument for using a cloud-based database was solid with strong evidence. I also think that I broke down the operating systems in good detail within my table.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Using the UML diagram helped to break down the structure of the program and gave good insight into some of the constrictions that might arise. This helps to identify problems early and keep the program efficient and effective.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The comparison table that investigated the different OSs could have been more specific, as the web-browser as one of the biggest concerns and constrictions. The charts should have looked deeper into how each OS interacts with web browsers and what is preferred by each OS.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Speed and usability were the biggest concerns that the client had. The user is the client’s priority because a user will not continue with the app if the functionality is poor.
